### Project rock-paper-scissors

It was one of my first React projects, as you can see here i learned useState quite a colorful way!

This project uses technologies below:

- `react`
- `styled-components`

And a small library named

- `color-randomizer`

for some random color codes with few format options to choose from. Notice some 'normal' color names are not supported by web browsers!
